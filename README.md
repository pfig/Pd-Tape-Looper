# Overview

When I was a kid I made simple tape loops by breaking off the sides of tape cassettes, and then spooling the tape through the two
cassettes (see the PDF). Now, I could buy a couple of Revox A77, but I don't fancy carting 20kg around with me; on the other hand I
don't have the money to duplicate Robert Fripp's setup (now unfortunately gone from the Guitar Geek database).

# Off-the-shelf solutions

I thought that in this day and age this would be easy to replicate with some digital thingy, but as it turns out, it's not (at least
not in an easy to carry format). Go figure.

## Boss Loopers (hardware)

Both the [RC-20XL][1] and the [RC-3][2] seem like they can do the job. I have an RC-3, but haven't had time to set it up and try it
out.

## SooperLooper (software)

[SooperLooper][3] is a lovely software package that seems to do exactly this, however it's got a manual as thick as a bible, and it
crashes all the time.

# Rolling My Own

Obviously I thought I could manage a far simpler SooperLooper in [Pd][4], which is what this repo is all about.

## Status

At this point I'm getting an error I don't understand. Stay tuned!
